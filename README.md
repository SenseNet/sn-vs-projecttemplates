# sensenet ECM Project templates
This repo contains project templates for [sensenet ECM](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet) web application projects.

All templates are based on the default **ASP.NET Web Application** template in **Visual Studio**. All projects are extended with **NuGet packages** of one or more sensenet ECM [components](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/sensenet-components). 

> The added NuGet packages is the only modification on the default template.

As a developer you can make use of these templates in several ways:

- *copy* one of these projects manually as a starting point, when you want to kickstart a new sensenet ECM solution. This will save you the process of creating a new web application and importing all the necessary sensenet ECM packages.
- use these projects in your *builds* as a skeleton of a complete website.

Please look for *readme* files in solution subfolders in this repository to see which sensenet ECM packages are installed in that solution.

> As sensenet ECM consists of many optional components, it is not feasible to provide templates for all combinations. If you think we should add a new project template with a particular package combination, please contact us - or better yet, add and [contribute it](CONTRIBUTING.md) yourself :).
